## RBE
For each shell that you run bazel in (directly or indirectly),
run `source google_internal/rbe_setup.sh`.
This may require configuring gcloud (one time).

Then, use `bazel_rbe` in place of `bazel` to utilize Kiwi's RBE to speed up building.
For example, `bazel_rbe test //...`

Now when building you should see **remote cache hit** in the bazel output.
This holds even when running local `bazel clean`.

In the future, this may also matter/help when using `builders` locally
The current version does not do any builders image pulling, but the original kiwi version does.

## Kokoro
TODO: move Kokoro to this directory, probably.
