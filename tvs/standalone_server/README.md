# Standalone TVS

The folder contains implementation of a standalone TVS server. Standalone
meaning that the server runs as one process.


This is in contrast of running the trusted part of the server in an enclave
(CVM) and the untrusted part that interface directly with the client outside of
the CVM.

To run the service you can follow [this instruction](../README.md).
